# Boilerplate Plugin

## Description
This plugin is a starting point for creating any plugin that relied in modern PHP development, such as OOP, Composer, and PHPUnit.

## How to use it?
Before anything, install dependencies by running `composer install && npm install`, then choose the mode you want to use:

### Development
Run `npm run dev`. This will watch for changes on admin/assets/src and will build them in the admin/assets/build folder in a non-minify/uglify way. 

### Production
Run `npm run build`. This will build files in admin/assets/src to admin/assets/build, the files will be placed in a minify-uglify way, ready to use.

## Contribution?
Umm, not really, it's just a personal project, however, if you still want it, just create a PR and I'll take a look.
